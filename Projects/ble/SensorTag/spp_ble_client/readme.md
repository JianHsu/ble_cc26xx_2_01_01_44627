Purpose / Scope
===============

This purpose of this example is to demonstrate a UART to BLE bridge using TI's proprietary Serial Port Profile (SPP)
The project is based on the [UART to BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) Bridge Reference Design](http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDC-SPPBLE-SW-RD), and has been enhanced to include Bluetooth 4.2 features such as Data Length Extension.

Prerequisites
=============

#### Hardware Requirements

Before running the demo, the user will need the following components:

- 2x [CC2650R2 LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc2640r2)
- 2x Micro USB cable

#### Firmware Requirements

- [BLE-Stack v3.0.1](http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK)

Serial Port Service (SPS)
=========================

The serial port service is made to implement a bi-directional UART connection over the BLE protocol. The service uses a 128 bit UUID: F000C0E0-0451-4000-B000-00000000-0000. SPS contains three characteristics, they are listed below.

| Characteristic    | UUID                                      |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|Data               | F000C0E1-0451-4000-B000-00000000-0000     |
|Status             | F000C0E2-0451-4000-B000-00000000-0000     |
|Config             | F000C0E3-0451-4000-B000-00000000-0000     |

For more information about the Serial Port Profile (SPP), please see the [TI-Design Guide](http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDC-SPPBLE-SW-RD) or the [SPS Spec Document](http://www.ti.com/lit/TIDUA63).





Running the Demo
================

Running the demo is as simple and compiling and loading the code, then hooking up to your PC to send a receive data over UART. Please see the steps below:

1. Compile and load the code
 - Build LaunchPad #1 with the `spp_ble_client` cc2640r2lp_stack-FlashROM_Library project
 - Build and load LaunchPad #1 with the `spp_ble_client` cc2640r2lp_app-FlashROM_StackLibrary project
 - Build LaunchPad #2 with the `spp_ble_server` cc2640r2lp_stack-FlashROM_Library project
 - Build and load LaunchPad #2 with the `spp_ble_server` cc2640r2lp_app-FlashROM_StackLibrary project

2. Connect the Boards to the PC terminal
 - You can use the terminal to send data from your PC to the LaunchPad, and also display the info sent from one device to another.
 - You will need to open two instances of the terminal program to, one to communicate with each board.
 - Follow the steps from our [FAQ](faq.md) to connect to the LaunchPad boards
 - **Please note that the SPP project uses the default baud rate of 115200**

2. Power the boards inividually and verify they are initialized
 - The client will blink the green LED twice at initialzation. It will also display `Auto connecting...` on the terminal
 - The server will blink the red LED once at initialization
 - The client will auto connect to the server using a hardcoded BD\_ADDR
 - Upon connecting the client will display: `Discovering services...Found Serial Port Service...Data Char Found...Notification enabled...`
 - At this point you can type into either terminal window and watch it being echoed to the other terminal via BLE.
